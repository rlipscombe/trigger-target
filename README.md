# trigger-target

Project that serves as the target for a Github Action trigger.

This repo represents (e.g.) the end-to-end tests for multiple repositories. It will be triggered by changes to the
`trigger-one` or `trigger-two` repositories.

Right now, I'm just messing around with Github Actions in general:

- Multiple YAML files.
- Multiple steps.
- Trigger on PR vs. Push.
